# TIM-app

## About this Project

This project was an idea of creating a tool that could help you track the time you put into projects.

## What is it?

Its a reverse to-do app. Its more like a "what i did" app. The complex part of this project was to create a firebase system, where you could create a project and log the individual time for each work session logged.

## What did i do and learn?

- I learned routing with :slugs.

- To use packages and manipulate them in order to create the visual effect i wanted. E.g. There is a stopwatch feature and it has a graphical element that progress's a circle. I found a progress bar package and combined it with some stopwatch logic.

- I learned to work with posting data and dynamicly generating pages in firebase.

## What would i do differently next time?

- I would use nextjs or maybe Remix instead of CRA... I dont particularly like the rendering method the app uses atm. 
- And for god sake... Excecuting the project. Do mobile first! I dont understand why I still keep making that mistake.
